Sketch MUST inclue:
    - Heavy use of imagery and text 
    - Manipulation of time 
    - Animation 
    - Movements
    - Play with location, color, pixels, and absence
The goal of sketch 4 is to create a generative design that animates a story and creates an interactive narrative

This sketch will be a "bullet journal" that allows teh user to interactively create a love letter 
This will include both text and imagery

04/11/2023:
    - started by making the function to create the bullet page where the letter will be written
    - also uploaded the images that will be used in the program
    - added the front cover and made it so if you click on the front cover it "opens" to the jouranl page 
    - imported a font and styled it so that the text fits within the lines of the journal
