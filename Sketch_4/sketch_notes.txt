Ideas and Notes for Sketch 4 -- Due 04/21/2023 @ 12:00pm

Sketch MUST inclue:
    - Heavy use of imagery and text 
    - Manipulation of time 
    - Animation 
    - Movements
    - Play with location, color, pixels, and absence
The goal of sketch 4 is to create a generative design that animates a story and creates an interactive narrative

This sketch will be a "bullet journal" that allows teh user to interactively create a love letter 
This will include both text and imagery

04/11/2023:
    - started by making the function to create the bullet page where the letter will be written
    - also uploaded the images that will be used in the program
    - added the front cover and made it so if you click on the front cover it "opens" to the jouranl page 
    - imported a font and styled it so that the text fits within the lines of the journal 

04/15/2023:
    - Working on setting up the function that allows the current line to break onto the next line once it reaches 
    past the length of the screen - the size of the text
    - Set up the function that adds a letter to the screen each time the user types something into the journal
    The inspiration for this is coming from the generative design example: P_3_1_2_01
    - Running into issues with wrapping the text as well as issues with getting the delete/backspace to work
